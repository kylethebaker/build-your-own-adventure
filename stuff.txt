Time Machine

machine itself is the hub. 
Make an important decision before reaching the machine.
5 times to go to, each loops back to the hub. Multiple endings for each time, some lead to death. All choices made affect a master variable for "butterfly effect".

After the quest in all 5 times is complete, you are given choice to go back to present (or ultra-secret choice to go back furhter into time and maybe join an ancient advanced civilization). The 5 choices for the present are actually 5 different endpoints, shown/hidden based on the butterfly effect variable (only one is visible). 

Something happens back in the present, where the decision you made at the beginning is reflected in this alternate present. How could this be possible? MYSTERIOUS OOO
