build-your-own-adventure
=============
A single-page app that provides an intuitive interface for users to create, play, and collaborate on their own "Choose Your Own Adventure" games.

build-your-own-adventure makes use of Knockout.js MVVM architecture to create a powerful interactivity with pure JSON documents.

Development has been heretofore top-down, but leaning toward CouchDb for eventual backend due to the json-based adventures.
